Feature: User Tests


  Scenario: User should be able to create an profile
    Given I have logged in as administrator

    When I try to create a user with:
      | username | firstName | lastName | email                      | timezone | verified | active | loginRestricted |
      | TestUser | FirstN    | LastN    | testowesoldevelo@gmail.com | CET      | false    | false  | false           |
    Then I should get response with the userâ€™s id

    When I try to get user with id
    Then I should get user with:
      | username | firstName | lastName | email                      | timezone | verified | active | loginRestricted |
      | TestUser | FirstN    | LastN    | testowesoldevelo@gmail.com | CET      | false    | false  | false           |

    And I logout
