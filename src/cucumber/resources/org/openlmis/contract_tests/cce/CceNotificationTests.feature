Feature: CCE Notification Tests

  Scenario: User with supervisory supervision role should get a notification about nonfunctional CCE
    Given I have logged in as divo1

    When I try to retrieve inventory items
    | facilityId                           | programId                            |
    | 4774fc63-a0c8-4a29-a01d-5b6b48632175 | 418bdc1d-c303-4bd0-b2d3-d8901150a983 |
    Then I should get response with inventory item with reference name "Fridge #166"

    When I try to change functionality status to AWAITING_REPAIR with NO_FUEL as a reason
    Then I should get response with inventory item with AWAITING_REPAIR functionality status
    And I pause for 60 seconds
