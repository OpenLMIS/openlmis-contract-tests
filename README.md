# openlmis-contract-tests

This repository is intended to contain contract tests of OpenLMIS 3.0

Contract tests should be organized around business scenarios that requires multiple services to work together.

Contract tests should be sending real http requests to and verifying real http response from running services. Mocking and stubbing techniques should reside within component tests of each single service.
